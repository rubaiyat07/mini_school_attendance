# AI Development Workflow Documentation

## 1. AI-assisted parts
- Generated boilerplate for Vue components (Students Page, Attendance Page)
- Assisted in writing Laravel Controllers and Service Layer
- Suggested Event/Listener & caching implementation

## 2. Example Prompts Used
1. "Generate a Laravel Resource Controller for Attendance with bulk recording"
2. "Create Vue 3 component for student list with search and pagination"
3. "Write Laravel Artisan command to generate monthly attendance report"

## 3. AI contribution to speed
- Saved 2–3 hours by generating initial CRUD and API boilerplate
- Vue UI components scaffolded in minutes

## 4. Manual vs AI-generated
- **Manual**: Custom attendance business logic, relationships, event wiring, testing, integration with backend
- **AI-generated**: Initial Vue component boilerplate, controller skeletons, API endpoint structure
